"""
Correlation network (MST) + semantic zoom for the Portfolio Builder.

Reuse (Phase 0 audit + Phase 1 answer #1): the ticker x ticker correlation
matrix is reconstructed from Phase 1's UniverseCache (correlation_row per
ticker, aligned to cache.get_correlation_index()) — plain-correlation
based, NOT DCC-GARCH (see fetch.py's module docstring for why: DCC-GARCH
is fit at sector count and has an unresolved convergence-misreport issue;
running it at ticker count would multiply that risk for a feature where a
wrong number is invisible in the UI).

Distance transform is the standard Mantegna (1999) MST metric,
d = sqrt(2*(1-rho)) — a fixed mathematical definition, not a tunable
business parameter, so it isn't a config field (same treatment as
Sharpe's formula being a fixed definition rather than a knob).

No 3D: this module only produces a networkx.Graph (2D-agnostic graph
structure with edge weights). Any (x, y) layout is a rendering concern
for Phase 5, not stored here.
